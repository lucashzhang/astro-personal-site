Over the last few years, I've worked/interned at various places such as Amazon, SAS, Duke University as well as my own school's Computer Science department. I've also taking an active role in my Computer Science community by doing things like directing the Carolina Data Challenge Hackathon and serving as the current President of the Computer Science + Social Good Club at UNC.
