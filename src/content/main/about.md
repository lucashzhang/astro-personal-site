Hello! My name is Lucas Zhang. I've recently graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a Computer Science Major and a Data Science Minor. This website is both my resume and my sandbox where I can explore new technologies that I find fun or interesting. This current site is custom designed by me and was built with [Astro.js](https://astro.build). It ships with 0 frontend JavaScript so all animations and behaviors are driven by the HTML and CSS of the site. See more in the repo [here](https://github.com/lucashzhang/astro-personal-site).
