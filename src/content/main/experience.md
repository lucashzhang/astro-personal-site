Over the last few years, I've worked and interned at various places such as Cisco, Amazon, SAS, Duke University as well as my own school's Computer Science department. I've also enjoyed taking an active role in my Computer Science community by doing things like directing the Carolina Data Challenge Hackathon and serving as the President of the Computer Science + Social Good Club at UNC.
